Managing text notes efficiently starts with a clear structure. Since you want to focus on naming and organization, these user stories are designed to cover the core lifecycle of a note—from creation to retrieval.

## 📝 User Stories: Text Note Management

### 1. Creating and Naming

**As a** user,
**I want to** assign a specific name to a note when I create it,
**So that** I can identify the content without having to open the file.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
* System prompts for a "Note Title" or "Filename" upon creation.
* The system prevents saving if the name field is empty.
* The system warns if a note with the same name already exists.



### 2. Renaming Existing Notes

**As a** user,
**I want to** change the name of an existing note,
**So that** I can update its label as the project or content evolves.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
* User can select a "Rename" option from the note settings.
* The new name is reflected immediately across the application.
* The original file content remains intact during the rename.



### 3. Browsing and Sorting

**As a** user,
**I want to** see a list of all my notes by their names,
**So that** I can quickly scan and find the information I need.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
* Notes are displayed in a searchable list or grid.
* The UI displays the note name prominently.
* Users can sort the list alphabetically by name.



### 4. Searching by Name

**As a** user,
**I want to** search for a note by typing its name into a search bar,
**So that** I can jump to a specific file without scrolling.

* **Acceptance Criteria:**
* The search results update in real-time as the user types.
* The system highlights matches within the note names.

## Proposed Data Structure

To keep things organized on the backend, you might consider a simple key-value relationship or a structured object:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `note_id` | UUID | Unique identifier for the system. |
| `note_name` | String | The user-defined name (e.g., "Grocery List"). |
| `content` | Text | The actual body of the note. |
| `last_modified` | DateTime | Timestamp for sorting purposes. |

> **Note:** When implementing naming, consider how you'll handle special characters (like `/` or `\`) to ensure compatibility across different operating systems if these notes are saved as local files.

Would you like me to draft the **technical requirements** or a **database schema** to support these user stories?
